# restaurant-page

SPA restaurant page project made for the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-restaurant-page)

This was an exercise to explore to SPA features via Javascript DOM manipulation. The entire page is generated by JS functions.  
I also experimented with adding Bootstrap through webpack, since I still wanted to use it to further expand my expertise with it. The configuration took a while, but it gave me a much better understanding of how exactly webpack accomplishes what it does.
